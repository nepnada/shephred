FlockGuard – AI-Powered Livestock Monitoring System

FlockGuard is an AI-driven livestock monitoring and management platform designed to help shepherds and farmers optimize grazing, monitor animal health, and detect predators in real time. The project combines computer vision, machine learning, and path optimization algorithms to provide actionable insights in low-resource farming environments.

Features
	•	Sheep Counting: Automatically detects and counts sheep in a field using computer vision models.
	•	Predator & Health Detection: Identifies predators and sick animals through deep learning, allowing timely intervention.
	•	Optimal Grazing Trajectories: Predicts the safest and most efficient grazing paths while considering restricted zones, protected forests, poisonous plants, and other environmental constraints.
	•	Real-Time Alerts: Sends notifications if predators are detected or if sheep are showing signs of illness.

Technologies Used
	•	Python for ML pipelines and data handling
	•	PyTorch / TensorFlow for computer vision models (YOLO, MobileNetV2)
	•	OpenCV for image processing
	•	Optimization Algorithms for trajectory planning
